"Merthiaal, the Guardian of Darkness on Yrathid, was the last guardian to be born during the First Cycle, and at the same time, she was the first guardian to perish. Although Yarae’s conflict had not yet begun, he did have an indirect role in causing Merthiaal’s downfall. The young guardian’s emotions clouded her reason; jealousy consumed her heart from inside as she watched her creator’s predilection for her sisters Uria and Xia’el.\n"
"\n"
"In a desperate attempt to prove her worth to Yarae and even surpass his own power, the girl subverted her world’s seed and tried to absorb its energy for herself. Alas, even though their blood was always one and the same, the guardian and the Seed of Darkness were never meant to become one."

However, Yarae was offended by the proposition; he refused to help with the resurrection and healing, choosing instead to preserve the lifeless world intact as a testament to his child’s hubris.\n"

"That incarnation of Uria would never be able to bring Merthiaal back to life, and the Guardian of Darkness would come to be known as the Eater of Souls, the antithesis of the Guardian of Light.
