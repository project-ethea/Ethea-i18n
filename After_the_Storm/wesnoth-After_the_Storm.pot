"By the onset of the end of the Golden Age, Wesmere’s trust in the Empire of Wesnoth had been breached; the humans’ unilateral decision to create a second sun was the trigger.

After some point, I simply decided to leave Wesmere and wander the earth with Argan by my side."

The unmatched prowess of the archers manning the village’s defense caught the elf by surprise, for he had never seen humans able to surpass elvenkind’s skill with the bow and arrow. He was so impressed, after the end of the battle he used his magic to give the Krysvelenians a parting gift: an enchanted bow that imbues any arrows shot with a powerful ice magic capable of slowing down targets to a crawl.\n"

While she could not tell them her own story, she was happy to listen to the Nameless One tell her all about the vast unknown that lay far beyond Irdya. And she in turn showed them Irdya as it was, and as it is — a world of endless strife, yet also endless beauty."
