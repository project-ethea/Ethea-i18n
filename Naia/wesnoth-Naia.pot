"There is much speculation as to the origins of the religious groups that eventually joined to form the Chaos Empire. Amongst scholars, the most popular theory postulates the creation of two separate cults by the same prophet approximately four centuries ago: the cult of Yechnagoth, centered around the western seaboard, and the cult of Chaos, which existed primarily throughout the eastern wastes.\n"
"\n"
"As time went on, the more prolific Chaos Magi’s sphere of influence expanded and absorbed Yechnagoth’s worshipers, reshaping their tenets and giving way to a unified religion worshiping Uria as the goddess who brought the Dark Lady back from the dead.\n"

"Legend has it that at the beginning of time, powerful creatures called ‘demons’ governed all that existed. The Lords of Light and Darkness, seeing the danger they posed for the balance of nature, banished them to a separate plane of existence, trapped with no means of escape from inside. But time and time again, different versions of the legend have been told by different peoples in different places. Presumably, whatever small amount of truth there was in the original version of the story has since been lost forever.\n"
"\n"
"Either by ignorance, or in an attempt to make sense of the fractured stories gathered from Chaos prisoners, the peoples of Irdya refer more generally to all the vastly heterogeneous races of Inferno by this generic designation. Some go as far as to claim that normal Irdyan creatures may become ‘demonic’ in some form or another, pointing at the Chaos Lorekeepers’ powers and inscrutable nature."
